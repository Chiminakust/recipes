# Ingredients

- butter, enough for the pan
- dutch process cocoa powder, 1/4 cup
- semisweet chocolate, 5 ounces, coarsely chopped
- unsalted butter, 6 tbs, cut into pieces
- neutral oil, 1/4 cup
- granulated sugar, 1/2 cup
- dark brown sugar, 1/2 cup, packed
- large egg, 1
- large egg yolks, 2
- vanilla extract, 1 1/2 tsp
- all purpose flour, 3/4 cups
- (opt) malted milk powder, 2 tbs
- kosher salt, / tsp
- milk chocolate, 6 ounces, coarsely chopped

# Preparation

- Preheat the oven and prepare the pan: Arrange an oven rack in the center
	position and preheat the oven to 350°F.
- Line an 8 × 8-inch pan with 2 sheets of foil, crossing one over the other
	and pressing the foil into the corners and up the sides.
- Lightly butter the foil and set aside.
- Bloom the cocoa: In a large heatproof bowl, whisk the cocoa powder and
	1/4 cup boiling water (4 oz / 113g) until smooth (this will bring out
	the flavor of the cocoa).
- Melt the chocolate, butter, and oil: Add the semisweet chocolate, butter,
	and oil to the bowl with the cocoa mixture and set it over a medium
	saucepan filled with about 1 inch of simmering (not boiling) water
	(make sure the bottom of the bowl isn’t touching the water).
- Warm the mixture gently, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate and
	butter are melted and the mixture is smooth.
- Remove the bowl from the heat and let cool until lukewarm.
- Add the sugars and egg: Whisk the granulated and brown sugars into the
	chocolate mixture.
- It will look grainy and you might see some of the fat start to separate
	from the rest of the mixture, which is normal.
- Add the whole egg, egg yolks, and vanilla and whisk vigorously until the
	mixture comes back together and looks very thick, smooth, and glossy.
- Add the dry ingredients: Add the flour, malted milk powder (if using), and
	salt and whisk slowly until everything is combined, then whisk more
	vigorously until the batter is very thick, a full 45 seconds.
- Fold in the chocolate and bake: Add the milk chocolate to the batter and
	fold with a flexible spatula to distribute.
- Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, spreading in an even layer all the
	way to the corners.
- Bake the brownies until the surface is shiny and puffed and the center is
	dry to the touch but still soft when pressed, 25 to 30 minutes.
- Cool, chill, and cut: Allow the brownies to cool in the pan until they are
	no longer hot, about 1 hour, then refrigerate until the bottom of the
	pan feels cold, about 1 hour longer (this results in a chewier texture).
- Use the ends of the foil to lift the brownies out of the pan and transfer to
	a cutting board.
- Slice the brownies into 16 squares.
