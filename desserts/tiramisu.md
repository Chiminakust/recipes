- 3 large egg yolks
- 1 / 2 cup sugar
- flavoring extract (e.g. vanilla, almond)
- 4 egg whites (can be from the eggs from the custard)
- 1 cup or 4 1 / 2 oz all purpose flour

## Custard

- 4 egg yolks
- 1 / 2 cup sugar
- 3 / 4 cup heavy cream
- 8 oz / 230 g mascarpone

## Tiramisu

- ladyfingers
- custard
- cooled espresso

- cocoa powder

# Preparation

## Lady fingers

- Into the bowl of a stand mixer, add 3 large egg yolks and ¼ cup of sugar and
	whisk together on half speed for about 2 minutes or until pale,
	yellow, and ribbony. While the mixer is running, add ½ teaspoon of any
	extract of your choice such as vanilla or almond. Set this mixture
	aside for later.
- Into another bowl of a stand mixer, whisk 4 egg whites on medium speed until
	they start to get light and foamy. Slowly stream in ¼ cup of sugar and
	continue whisking for about 2 to 3 minutes until it holds stiff peaks. 
- Add the egg yolk mixture to the egg white mixture and gently fold together
	until almost combined, but still streaky. Add 1 cup or about
	4 ½ ounces of all-purpose flour that is sifted to prevent lumps.
	Gently fold together and make sure not to release all of the air out
	of the batter.
- Using a piping bag or a Ziploc bag with the corner cut off, pipe the batter
	onto a parchment lined baking sheet and bake at 375°F for about 14
	minutes. Make sure to carefully rotate them once while they are
	baking. Once the baking is completed, they should be light, crisp, and
	golden brown. 
- Once the ladyfingers are fully cooled, gently pull them off the parchment
	paper.

## Custard

- Into the bowl of a stand mixer, add 4 egg yolks and ¼ cup of sugar and whisk
	for about 3 minutes on medium-high speed until tripled in volume. Set
	aside for later and clean off your whisk attachment. 
- Into another bowl of a stand mixer, beat ¾ cup of heavy cream and ¼ cup of
	sugar for about 1 to 2 minutes on medium-high speed until you end up
	with whipped cream. Add 8 ounces of room-temperature mascarpone cheese
	and beat for about 30 seconds to 1 minute until it is thick and
	spreadable. Add the egg yolk mixture to the whipped cream mixture and
	stir until combined.  

## Tiramisu

- Spread a little bit of custard in the bottom of a ring mold or a springform
	pan. Line the inside rim with ladyfingers rounded side out.
- For layering, dunk some smaller ladyfingers into some cooled off espresso
	with an optional splash of dark rum or amaretto and arrange as many of
	them as possible in a single layer lined up in the bottom of the pan.
	If necessary, cut up the ladyfingers if there are any large gaps that
	need to be filled in. 
- Add just enough custard to cover the coffee soaked ladyfingers and repeat
	until the mold is nearly filled to the top. Top it off with a little
	dusting of cocoa powder. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 to 24
	hours until it is nice and firm.
