# Ingredients

- Bread flour
- water
- yeast
- salt

Quantities vary according to recipe. Quantities are always represented in
baker's percent, meaning the quantity is always relative to 1 kg of flour.

# Preparation

## *Mise en place*
- prepare yeast according to instructions on packet
- mix ingredients together and make sure dough is at about 24 °C

## *Pétrissage*
- knead for about 10 minutes and form into a ball

## *Pointage*
- let rise for 1h to 1h30, until doubled in size

## *Division*
- cut in pieces of the desired mass
	+ baguette 350g
	+ bâtard 500g
	+ loaf 600g

## *Boulage*
- form in balls

## *Détente*
- let rest 15 minutes under plastic wrap

## *Façonnage*
- form into desired shape

## *Apprêt*
- let rise for 45 min to 1h30 (bigger pieces need more time)
- preheat the oven at the highest temperature possible
- optionally, place an aluminium plate of water in the over,
	more humidity let's the crust rise more before setting
- score the pieces

## *Cuisson*
- cook at 420 °f for baguettes, 400 °f for the rest for 20 to 30 min


# Notes

## Why are quantities in mass instead of volume?

Because the density of certain ingredients, especially flour, can vary
according to ambiant temperature, humidity and other factors. 1 kg of flour
will always be 1 kg of flour, 6 cups of flour on a hot summer day may not be
the same mass as 6 cups of flour when it's raining the next week.

## Dough still very sticky when kneading

Various factors come into play for this. Most likely, the gluten is not
properly developped due to improper kneading. Make sure to create layers when
kneading and fold the dough unto itself. Also, when forming the ball, you can
use the friction between the dough and the table to help create an outer dryer
layer. To do this, place your hands together at the bottom of the dough (the
dough is between you and your hands) and pull the dough towards you. Rotate the
dough and repeat to make it even. As you do this, you should see the bottom of
the dough getting absorbed into itself, and the top of the dough stretching.

Another cause of underdevelopped gluten may be that the yeast was not activated
properly. In this case, you will usually have to start over, but you may as
well try searching the internet for solutions.

Finally, you may try to add flour to make it dryer. Adding a bit of flour is
perfectly normal, but you should start asking yourself some questions if you
find yourself adding more than 25% of the original quantity.

## How to have a nice crust

A nice crust can be helped by doing two things: proper scoring of the dough
and control of humidity.

Scoring the bread is done to give the bread a direction in which to grow when
cooking. This helps the bread to grow upward and not from its sides. To score
the bread nicely, use your sharpest and thinest blade and make precise, fast
and delibrate cuts. Do not cut too deep, cut only about 2 cm deep.

Humidity helps the bread grow bigger because the crust will set faster in a dry
environment. If the crust sets before the bread is fully developped, your bread
will not grow as big as it could have. To create a humid environment in your
oven, simply place an aluminium plate containing water in your oven when
preheating. You can remove it when placing your bread in or let it inside,
depending if you think you lost a lot of humidity when you opened your oven.
Be careful when opening your oven, a lot of steam will come out and may burn
you.

## How to properly preheat your oven

You should always preheat your oven to its maximum allowed temperature and set
the temperature back down after the bread is placed inside. This is because
heat is lost when you open the door to place your bread in. By doing this, you
can get more consistent baking temperatures.
