# Ingredients

## Vegetables

All vegetables should be diced to about the same size (~1cm cubes).

- bell peppers, various colors (red, orange and yellow encouraged), 3, diced
- large red onion, 1, diced
- celeri sticks, 2-3, diced
- carrots, 2-3, diced
- green onion, 2, diced


## Pasta

- pasta of choice (e.g. fusili), 500g
- salt

## Dressing

- mayo, 1 1/2 cup (maybe more, to taste)
- white vinegar, 3 tbs
- garlic powder, 2 tbs
- sugar, 2 tbs
- salt

# Preparation

- Cook the pasta to almost al dente, then drain but do not rinse.
	Let cool completely in a bowl.
- Combine the dressing ingredients.
- Chop the vegetables, combine them all *except the onion* in a bowl.
- Set the onion aside in a bowl and season them with salt and vinegar.
	(Just enough vinegar to wet the onions, not soak them. This is to
	neutralize their raw flavour.)
- When the pasta is cooled, combine everything and let chill in the
	fridge for at least 2 hours (this is important, you can taste it before to
	confirm for yourself that the flavour develops).
- Serve cold.
