- Season with salt and pepper

- Cook for about 2 minutes
- Pre-heat the oven to 375Â°f.
- Add the broth and reduce until moist but not liquid (like sloppy joe)
- Add the peas and corn and mix, remove from heat
- In a large cooking dish (e.g. 9x9"), add the meat mix at the bottom and top
	with the potatos.
