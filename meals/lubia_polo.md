# Ingredients

- 2 cups basmati rice white,
	(recommend 1 ⅓ cup white rice + ⅔ cup brown basmati rice)
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 onion medium, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic grated
- 1 pound lamb ground, 90% lean
- 1 teaspoon advieh Persian spice mix or curry powder
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme or dried savory
- 1¼ teaspoon salt adjust as needed
- 1 teaspoon dried lime powder or 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 pound green beans cut into ½ inch or frozen
- 6 ounces tomato paste
- ⅓ teaspoon saffron powdered and dissolved in 2 tablespoons hot water

# Preparation

## Cook meat and beans
- Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil at medium setting in a cooking pot.
- Add the chopped onions and sauté few minutes.
- Then add the grated garlic and continue to sauté until the onions are
	light golden brown.
- Add the ground lamb and sauté.
- Then add all the spices, dried herbs, ½ tsp salt (advieh/curry powder
	through lemon powder) and stir for 2 to 3 minutes.
- Add the green beans.
- Next add the tomato paste and mix it well.
- If the mixture is too thick, may add a some water, cover and let it simmer
	until the beans are ¾th done.
- It will continue to cook in the steaming process in the next steps.
- The mixture should be moist but not too wet.

## Cook Rice

- Rinse the white basmati rice in water several times until the water is clear
	and not starchy.
- Then drain the rice very well in a colander.
	(Tip: Basmati rice often has fine starchy powder on the top and you must
	get rid of that.)
- Stove Top Method: Bring 6 cups of water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil.
- Add the rice and allow it to boil at medium high heat for about 5 to 6 minutes
	until the rice grains are soft.
- Stir the rice in between.
- Drain the rice and set aside.
- (Tip: The rice should be cooked to al dente stage.
- It should have expanded well, soft at the tips, see a white dot in the center
	and holds its shape well).
- Rice Cooker Method: Bring 3 cups water, ¾ teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon olive
	oil to a rolling boil.
- Add the rice and cook it just until all the water is absorbed, which should take
	about 15 to 20 minutes in a rice cooker.
- Do not let the rice steam after the water is absorbed.
- Or it will clump together.

## Assemble Rice with Meat/Green Beans

- Stove Top Method: Place the cooked rice with the sautéed meat/green bean mixture
	in several alternating layers in a heavy bottomed wide cooking pot.
- Sprinkle 1 tablespoon olive oil and saffron water all over.
- (Tip: You can make an optional potato crust or rice crust - video).
- Turn up the heat to medium high for about 10 minutes and then reduce the heat
	to the low setting and simmer for about 20 to 30 minutes or more until the
	steam builds up well.
- Rice Cooker Method: Alternatively, you could also layer the rice with meat/green
	beans and steam it together in a rice cooker.
- Once the rice is ready, turn off the heat.
- Gently mix the layers of the Persian Green bean rice.
- Serve this Persian lubia polo with salad shirazi or Persian yogurt dip with
	shallots or a green salad, pickles and/or pickled olives.
