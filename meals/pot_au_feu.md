# Ingredients

## Beef and broth
- various cuts of beef (flank, oyster blade low ribs, chuck,
	shank, etc)
- 500 g beef bones with marrow
- 4 L water
- 30g + 1 tsp salt

## Aromatics
- 1 celery
- 2 big carrots
- 2 big leeks
- 2 big potatoes
- 2 parsnip
- peppercorns
- 3 cloves (giroffle)
- 1 onion
- turnips

## Garnish
- 4 carrots
- 2 turnips
- 2 leeks
- nice bread

# Preperation

- In a large stock pot start by adding all of the bones and meats
	at the bottom of the pan
- Cover with 3 litre of cold water then turn the heat on high
	and bring to the boil
- As soon as the boils start a lot of impurities will start to
	float on the top (which is normal) and you will have to start
	scooping that scum out with a slotted spoon
- When done add 330 ml of cold in the pan which will stop the boiling
- Clear the excess of impurities on floating at the top and bring
	back to the boil.
- You will have to repeat the process of cleaning and adding cold
	water to the pan 3 times in total so that you end up at the end
	with a total of 4 liter ( approx.1 gallon of liquid) so each
	time you add water it should be around 330ml which just a bit
	more than a cup)

After the third ‘clean” you meat should well on its way to cook and
	the broth should be fairly clear and clean without too much
	fat on the top
- It is now time to add the salt, peppercorns a well as the
	vegetables (see vegetable used for flavouring in the ingredient list)
- When reduce the heat to a simmer, cover the pan with a lid
	(leaving an opening as large as 2 fingers wide for the steam to
	escape) and leave to cook up to 3 hours (or until your meat is
	cooked, which can depends on how thick or tough you met pieces are)

## Step 2 discard the flavouring vegetables and finish cooking the meat

- After an 45 minutes to an hour discard the vegetables used for the
	flavouring, remove any impurities floating at the top again then put
	the lid back on (partly close) and leave the meat to simmer on a
	gentle boil until it is totally cooked (to know when the meat is
	cooked just take a piece out and if you can detach pieces of meat
	with your finger then it is ready) when the meat is totally cooked
	you can start cooking the vegetable use for the garnish.

## Cooking the vegetable for the garnish

- It is now time to wash and peel the vegetables for the garnish
- Once done leave the potatoes whole (or cut them in half if they
	are too big), cut the turnips in quarters, the carrots and leeks
	in medium size chunks too (make sure you only use the white and
	yellow part of the leeks)

- The cooking of the vegetables need to be done separately so you will have
	to boil the potatoes in one pan and the carrots, turnips and leeks in another
- Usually it is custom to use some of the beef broth as cooking liquid
	for the vegetable which will give them a really nice flavour

## Serving the pot au feu

- It is important to remember that the pot au feu at its core is
	a simple family dish
- So there is no expectations for fancy plating or anything of the sort
- Typically for 4 to 6 patrons a pot au feu is served as follow:
- In one large dish, place all of the pieces of meat in the middle
	and arrange all the vegetables around the meats.
- Decorate with a bit of chop parsley
- Add on the table two little bowl with chopped gherkins and Dijon
	mustard (or any mustard you like)
- I personally like to add a bit of freshly mayonnaise as well on the table
- Finally you can also serve a soup dish with some of the beef broth
	so people can help themselves to it if they wish to.
