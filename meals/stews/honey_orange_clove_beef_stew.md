# Ingredients

- beef or veal shanks (osso bucco), 1 kg
- flour, 3 tbs
- carrot, 1, diced
- small turnip or parsnip, 1, diced
- cloves of garlic, 1 or 2, bruised
- red wine, 1 cup
- beef or veal stock, 300 mL
- cloves, 4
- orange zest, 1
- honey, 2-3 tbs
- branch of thyme, 1
- oil
- tomato paste, 1 (big) tbs
- salt and pepper

# Preparation


- Season meat with a good coating of salt and pepper, and then lightly dust
	each side with flour
- Heat oil in pot and over a medium to high heat brown the meat on each side.
- Be sure not to overcrowd the pot and if necessary brown in batches. Keep the
	browned meat aside.
- Reduce the heat to low, add a little extra oil if necessary and put the
	garlic, carrot, onions and turnips (or parsnips) into the pot and sweat
	the vegetables for 2-3 minutes.
- Add tomato paste and mix well and then pour in the wine and deglaze the pot.
	Simmer for a few minutes to reduce the liquid.
- Pour in the stock and bring back to a simmer and then add the branch of
	thyme, the cloves, the orange peel and the honey, stir well and then
	return to a simmer.
- Gently place the meat back into the pot – if using osso bucco remove the
	bone from enough of the pieces to enable them to fit into the pot
	comfortably.
- Simmer with the lid on for 2 to 2 ½ hours (or longer if necessary depending
	on the size of the meat. When the bones detach easily, or the meat
	comes apart easily if boneless meat is used, the dish is cooked.
- Serve with your favourite pasta, or if you prefer, rice or potatoes, and
	some bread.


# Notes

- I used 3 carrots and 3 parsnip and a large onion because I wanted more
	vegetables
- I also use 3 orange zests and about 6-7 cloves
- add flour at the end if the clove/orange is too strong and let cook 15
	more minutes
