- 100 g | 3.5 oz cucumber (about 2 large pickling cucumbers, either fresh or pickled – see note above)
- 6 spring onions or 10 green onion leaves
- 2 hard-boiled eggs
- 1.5 litres | 3 pints kefir (or 500 ml | 1 pint thick natural yoghurt and 1 litre | 2 pints buttermilk)
- Bunch fresh dill
- Juice of ½ a lemon (optional)
- Salt to taste 

## For the side dish

- 200 g | 7 oz potatoes

# Preparation

- Peel the potatoes and chop into bite-sized pieces. Place in a saucepan of boiling water, add a good pinch of salt and boil until a knife can easily pierce the flesh.
- While the potatoes are boiling, assemble the soup.
- Slice the beetroot & gherkins into fine julienne.
- Chop the eggs into small dice.
- Chop the scallions or onions leaves into 1 cm (½ inch) pieces.
- Finely chop the dill.
- Pour the kefir into a large bowl or saucepan and add the chopped ingredients and half of the lemon juice, holding back some of the dill for garnish.
- Taste and season salt and additional lemon juice as required.
- Ladle the soup into bowls and sprinkle with the remaining dill.
- Serve the potatoes on a side plate so that they do not heat the soup.
