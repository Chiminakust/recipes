## cheese sauce

- medium cheddar, 5oz / 150g, shredded 

# Preparation

- Use the power of finger strength to break the cauliflower into bite sized
	pieces 
	(If you use the frozen stuff, don’t bother breaking it)
- Toss in a bowl with 3 tablespoons of olive oil and some salt and
	pepper pepper pepper 
- Bake in the undoh at 425 for 20 minutes then wrassle it up.
	(If you used the frozen stuff, use your wangjangler to break up the
	bigger pieces now)
- Bake it up to another 20 but keep an eye on it.
	Once it’s brown enough for you, take it out. 
- The frozen stuff may take a bit longer
- Heat the milk on medium and whisk in the flour
- Add in the chives, Sriracha, salt and bring to a boil. 
- Remove from the heat then add in the cheese and wangjangle until smooth
- Then either plate and drizzle or give the cauliflower a ride down the
	Parchment Paper Express™ and combine
- Then eat it and realize it’s better than mac and cheese.
	It just is. It really, truly is. 
- If you disagree, keep making it and eating it until you change your mind.
