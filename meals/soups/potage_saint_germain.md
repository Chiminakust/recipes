# Notes

- This recipe comes from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHsF-bK9xsg
- Using the whole leak and more onion will have an effect on the taste,
	but it's still delicious
- this may be better using bacon, but the pork flavour is really a good
	addition to the regular vegetable *potage*, so either way it's tasty
- Some recipes also add potatoes and it's probably a good idea
- I used way to much vegetables the first time making this and it's still good,
	this recipe is pretty forgiving and you should go with whatever you
	think will work
