# Ingredients

- whole bone-in pork shoulder, 1
- lard, 2 lbs 
- water, 1 cup
- large navel oranges, 2
- large onion, roughly chopped, 1/2
- large cloves garlic, crushed, 4 
- dried bay leaves, 4
- cinnamon sticks, 2
- cumin seeds, 1 tsp
- Mexican oregano, 1 Tbsp
- light Mexican beer, 1/2 cup
- evaporated milk, 1/2 cup 

# Preparation

- Start by deboning, deskinning, and defatting the pork shoulder. Remove as much
	meat off the bone as possible. Cut the meat into 2-inch pieces.  
- In a large, wide dutch oven, add in 2 lbs of lard along with 1 cup of water
	over medium-high heat until the lard is completely melted. 
- Slowly and carefully add in the pork along with the juice and flesh of 2 large
	navel oranges cut in half. Bring to a bare simmer. 
- Once simmering, lower the heat to medium-low and maintain a bare simmer for
	2 hours. 
- After the first hour, remove the pieces of orange and replace it with ½ a large onion
	roughly chopped, 4 large cloves of crushed garlic, 4 dried bay leaves,
	2 sticks of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds, and 1 tablespoon of Mexican
	oregano. Mix together before adding in ½ cup each of light Mexican beer and
	evaporated milk. Mix together.
- Cook for an additional hour while stirring occasionally. 
- After 2 hours, remove the carnitas from the pot and place it in the fridge
	until ready to use. When ready to use, simply reheat the carnitas and serve.

# Notes

- Lard is not pork fat, it's white and looks like a brick of butter
