# Notes
- yields about 6 crepes
- gives nice french style crepes with a firm texture


# Ingredients

- 1 cup all purpose flour
- 1 cup milk
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 tsp salt


# Preparation

- Put the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl, and whisk to break the lumps.
	(or sift the flour first)
- Form a nest in the middle of the flour
- Add the eggs in the nest and whisk to combine, leaving the outer ring of flour intact
- Whisk in such a way the the flour incorporates into the egg mix only by sticking to it.
	(this avoids lumps in the batter)
- Gradually add the milk while mixing
- Keep mixing until the batter has a nice texture, add milk if too dense
- For better results, refrigerate overnight
- Pre-heat a large non stick skillet on the stove on high
- Pour a small portion of the batter in the skillet and cook until the edges start to curl
	and the crepe does not stick to the pan (patience)
- Flip and cook the other side
- Repeat until no more batter remains
