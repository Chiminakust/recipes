Ingredients:

For the Mashed Potatoes (Alternately, use 4 c of leftover, seasoned mashed potatoes, warmed and beaten until smooth.)

2 lbs potatoes, peeled and quartered
1/3 c milk
½ Tbsp salted butter
¾ tsp salt
¼ tsp garlic powder
1/8 tsp ground black pepper

For the Dish

½ Tbsp salted butter
1 onion, diced
1 lb ground beef (90% lean)
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp thyme
¼ tsp salt
2 c sweet corn,* thawed if frozen

Preparation:

- Preheat the oven to 350F.
- Put peeled and quartered potatoes into a medium soup pot and cover with water
- Bring to a boil and simmer for 15-20 minutes, until the potatoes are very tender
- Drain and add the milk, ½ Tbsp butter, ¾ tsp salt, garlic powder, and black pepper
- Beat using an electric hand mixer to achieve very smooth and fluffy mashed potatoes
  (If using leftover mashed potatoes, beat them to create a smooth texture, 
  adding a splash of milk if necessary.) Set the potatoes aside.
- In a large skillet, heat ½ Tbsp butter
- Add the diced onion and sauté over medium-high heat until the onions are golden, 3-5 minutes
- Add the ground beef and brown the beef until it is cooked through.
- Pour the onion and beef mixture into the bottom of a greased 8x8 baking dish
- Evenly distribute the corn over the meat
- Finally, dollop the potatoes over the corn, spreading them even to create a top crust.
- Place the dish in the oven and bake for 30-40 minutes, until the top is golden brown.
